Will They Work? 
===============

1. max (length [1, 2, 3]) (length [8, 9, 10, 11, 12])
   - Will work
   - Returns 5 
   - max type signature specifies two arguments that implement Ord (length returns Int- which has instance of Ord)

2. compare (3 * 4) (3 * 5)
   - Will work
   - Returns LT
   - compare expects two arguments that implement Ord (* returns Int- which has instance of Ord) 

3. compare "Julie" True
   - Breaks
   - compare expects arguments to implement one type of Ord.
   - Mixed types throws error

4. (5 + 3) > (3 + 6)
   - Works
   - Both expressions return Int values, Int has typeclass instance for (>)
