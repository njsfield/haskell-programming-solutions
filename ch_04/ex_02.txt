1. not True && True                 (compiles)
2. not (x = 6)                      (fails)
   not (x == 6)                     (compiles when x is in scope (and Int))
3. (1 * 2) > 5                      (compiles)
4. [Merry]   > [Happy]              (fails)
   ["Merry"] > ["Happy"]            (compiles to true)

5. [1, 2, 3] ++ "look at me!"       (fails)
   ['1', '2', '3'] ++ "look at me!" (compiles)
