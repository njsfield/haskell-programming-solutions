Parametricity
=============

1. We can only use 1 implementation
  bang :: a -> a 
  bang a = not a (bottom...)

2. We can only use 2 implementations
  pp :: a -> a -> a
  pp a b = a
  pp a b = b
  pp a b = not a (bottom...)

3. We can only use 1 implememtation 
  pp' :: a -> b -> b
  pp' a b = b
  Behaviour can change only is constraints are
  implemented
