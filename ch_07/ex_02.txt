1) 

  k (x, y) = x
  k1 = k ((4-1), 10)
  k2 = k ("three", (1 + 2))
  k3 = k (3, True) 

  a) k  :: (x, y) -> x
  b) k2 :: [Char]    (not the same as k1/k3)
  c) All three will return 3, though k2 will return string of "three"

2) 

  f :: (a, b, c) -> (d, e, f) -> ((a, d), (c, f))
  f (a, b, c) (d, e, f) = ((a, d), (c, f))
